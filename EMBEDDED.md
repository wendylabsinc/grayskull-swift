# Swift Embedded & WASM Compatibility Guide

The canonical version of this guide now lives in the DocC catalog at `Sources/Grayskull/Documentation/Grayskull.docc/Embedded.md` so it can ship with the generated API documentation. Generate DocC docs (for example with `swift package generate-documentation`) to read the rendered article or open the file directly if you need the Markdown source.
